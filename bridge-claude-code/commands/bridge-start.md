description: "Start BRIDGE implementation - plan and execute slices from requirements"

Load docs/requirements.json and docs/context.json.

Plan and execute the next slice using the bridge-slice-plan skill. Delegate to subagents: bridge-architect (if design needed), bridge-coder (implementation), bridge-debugger (if tests fail).

Start with the first recommended slice or the slice indicated in context.json next_slice.
