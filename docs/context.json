Added hard constraint: NEVER switch to Ask mode — use HUMAN: blocks for user input, delegate to sub-tasks for code investigation. Root cause: S05 fix was post-hoc (told AI to recover after switching) instead of preventive (tell AI not to switch). Tar.gz rebuild needed."

Added native `.codex/skills/` tree (26 skills) as compatibility target, kept `.agents/skills/` as authoring mirror, standardized command references to `$bridge-*`, aligned status vocabulary to planned/in-progress/review/done/blocked, fixed eval filename expectation and context path typo, and added `quality_gates.e2e_critical_paths` to codex requirements template. Updated codex config with optional `profiles.bridge` (gpt-5-codex + reasoning summary auto + web search)."
