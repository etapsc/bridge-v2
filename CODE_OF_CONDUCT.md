# Code of Conduct

## Our Commitment

We are committed to providing a friendly, safe, and welcoming environment for everyone, regardless of background, identity, experience level, or personal characteristics.

## Expected Behavior

- Be respectful and constructive in discussions.
- Focus feedback on ideas, code, and outcomes, not people.
- Assume good intent and ask clarifying questions before escalating.
- Help maintain a collaborative and inclusive environment.

## Unacceptable Behavior

- Harassment, discrimination, or hateful language.
- Personal attacks, intimidation, or threats.
- Publishing private information without explicit permission.
- Any conduct that would reasonably make participation unsafe.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to all project spaces, including issues, pull requests, discussions, reviews, and other community interactions.

## Reporting

If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior, contact the repository maintainers through a private GitHub channel (for example, the maintainer email listed on their GitHub profile). Please do not file public issues for conduct incidents.

## Enforcement

Maintainers may remove, edit, or reject contributions and interactions that violate this Code of Conduct. Repeated or severe violations may result in temporary or permanent exclusion from project spaces.
